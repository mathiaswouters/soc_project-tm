# Security Operations Center

In this project, I designed and implemented a comprehensive Security Operations Center (SOC) as part of my coursework in Cybersecurity. The SOC is designed to detect, analyze, and respond to various security incidents using a variety of tools and techniques. The core objective of this project was to create a robust system capable of monitoring and defending an internal network against potential cyber threats.
